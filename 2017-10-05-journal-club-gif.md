# Detecting UP and DOWN states 
![**Figure 1**. In the synchronised state (urethane anesthesia) the population oscillates between a low-rate UP state and a quiscent DOWN state.](figures/elife-22425-fig1-v2.jpg){height=60%}

# UP and DOWN statistics

![**Figure 2**. Transitions between UP and DOWN states are irregular but their lengths are temporally correlated.](figures/elife-22425-fig2-v2.jpg)

# Dynamics of population rate in UP and DOWN states

![**Figure 3** The population firing rate stays stable during the UP state and incrases slightly at the end of the DOWN state.](figures/elife-22425-fig3-v2.jpg)

# Simplified rate model of UP and DOWN states

![**Figure 4**. A model with threshold-linear transfer function of inhibitory and excitatory populations manifests the stable DOWN (quiscent) and UP (low non-zero rate) states. ](figures/elife-22425-fig4-v2.jpg){width=75%}

# Exploring the parameter space

![**Figure 5**. The transitions between UP and DOWN states can be either fluctuation- or adaptation-driven depending on the adaptation strength and firing threshold of the inhibition. ](figures/elife-22425-fig5-v2.jpg){width=75%}

# Dynamics of the inhibitory and excitatory firing rate in the model

![**Figure 6**. Although the adaptation affects only E population, both in model and data the I rate decays at the end of UP state. Conversely, the E rate increases slightly at the end of DOWN state.](figures/elife-22425-fig6-v2.jpg)

# Spiking network model of UP and DOWN state

![**Figure 7**. In the spiking network with bi-stable membrane dynamics the UP-to-DOWN transitions are spontaneous but DOWN-to-UP transitions require an external synchronous "kick".](figures/elife-22425-fig7-v2.jpg){height=60%}

# Key Points

* irregular up-down transitions
* serial correlations between UP/DOWN states lengths
* noise- vs adaptation-driven transitions
* change of firing rate at the onset vs. offset of UP state in inhibitory and excitatory neurons
* DOWN to UP transitions in realistic models with moderate noise
* origins of "kicks" - hand waving arguments (sparse connectivity, synchronous events, thalmocortical inputs)
* inhibition stabilised vs. shunting inhibition (Kumar 2008, Latham 2000) vs. contractive nonlinearity (Amit & Brunel, 1997)
